Project Name: Hosting a Scalable Website using AWS EC2, Route 53, Load Balancer, and Custom Domain

Overview:
In this project, I deployed a fully functional website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using core infrastructure components such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), Route 53, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and a custom domain. The goal was to host a simple yet scalable web application that is accessible through a registered domain name over the internet.

Architecture and Implementation Steps:
EC2 Instance Setup:
Launched multiple EC2 instances running Amazon Linux/Ubuntu as the hosting environment.
Installed and configured a web server (Apache/Nginx) on each instance to serve the website files (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
Deployed the website content to /var/www/html.
Configured security groups to allow inbound HTTP (port 80).

Load Balancer Configuration:
Created an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instances.
Configured target groups and registered the EC2 instances to ensure health checks determine if an instance is healthy and able to receive traffic.
Enabled HTTP listener on port 80 for initial setup and prepared for HTTPS integration for security.

Domain and Route 53 Setup:
Purchased/used a registered domain from a domain registrar.
Configured an AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone for the domain.
Created A records in Route 53 pointing the domain (sparktechnology.online) to the ALBâ€™s DNS name.
Ensured DNS propagation so that the domain resolves to the load balancer.

Testing and Validation:
Verified that the domain name successfully points to the load balancer and that traffic is distributed across the EC2 instances.
Tested high availability by stopping one EC2 instance and confirming that the load balancer routed traffic to the remaining healthy instance(s) without downtime.
Ensured cross-browser compatibility and responsive design for the website.

Outcome:
The website is now accessible globally by entering the domain name in a web browser.
The architecture is scalable (can add/remove EC2 instances without downtime) and highly available (load balancer ensures continuous operation).
